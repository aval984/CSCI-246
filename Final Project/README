this program was made for and run on a raspberry pi 4 with a rpi camera module while doing reasearch i found a neat way to pass multiple command line args using a json file so i dont have to pass multiple options when i run it. im using a camera resolution of 1920x1080 and a fps of 30. 
this program uses mostly premade libs to do all the heavy lifting. 
i have one class that i made to save the images to disk. the basic way this works is using the picamera to continuously capture frames, it then resizes the frames and filters the images to remove color and add a blur. it then averages some frames to get a "static" base image to compare against. 
some more opencv libs are used to make the image monochromatic b/w, dilate the white areas and find a contour of the white areas, this contour is how movement is detected, by comparing the contours of different frames. i then check the the size of the contours if they are below my min i ignore them else i print some stuff to the screen, check if the min time between image saves has passed(1s) and the min number of frames  have movement(3) if so i write the image to disk and reset the counter the whole time the video feed is displaying to the screen.  the program quits when 'q' is pressed
